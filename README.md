# Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): Pregnancy Risk Prediction Model

## 1. Project Planning and Management
- Define scope and objectives  
- Stakeholder analysis  
- Resource planning  
- Timeline and budget estimation  

## 2. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Data acquisition from relevant sources  
- Cleaning and preprocessing data  
- Data transformation and encoding  
- Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets  

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Generate statistical summaries  
- Create visualizations to explore patterns  
- Analyze feature correlation  

## 4. Model Development
- Select appropriate algorithms  
- Train models with training data  
- Perform hyperparameter tuning  
- Validate models using cross-validation  

## 5. Model Evaluation
- Assess accuracy with metrics (F1-score, AUC-ROC)  
- Analyze confusion matrix and errors  

## 6. Model Optimization and Integration
- Use advanced computation (GPU, parallelization)  
- Apply ensemble techniques  
- Improve model explainability (SHAP, LIME)  

## 7. Deployment
- Serialize model (joblib, pickle)  
- Develop API with Flask or FastAPI  
- Deploy model to server or cloud  

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance
- Monitor real-time model performance  
- Implement feedback loop  
- Plan for periodic retraining  

## 9. Documentation and Reporting
- Document processes and methodology  
- Create user and technical manuals  
- Final project report and presentation
